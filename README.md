Users enter a URL in the browser, which Route 53 resolves to an IP address. Traffic is managed by a Load Balancer. The frontend, built with React and MUI, is deployed on S3 and delivered via CloudFront CDN. A separate S3 bucket stores doctor profile photos.

The backend is containerized with Docker and runs on EC2 using Node.js and Express. Socket.IO provides real-time updates, and Bull manages asynchronous tasks. Data is stored in RDS (PostgreSQL), and Redis on another EC2 instance handles caching and queue management.

Gmail Service is used to send password reset emails.

## Local development

### Setup

The following tools need to be installed on your system in advance:

- `git`: `>=2`
- `nodejs`: `>=16 <17`
- `npm`: `>=8 <9`
- `docker`: `>=18.09`
- `docker-compose`: `>=1.28.6` (service profiles is not supported until version `1.28.0`)

### Install dependency

First clone the repository, then run the following commands to install the dependencies:

```shell
npm clean-install
```

**please do not use the command npm install as it might upgrade dependencies unintentionally**

### Setup database

1. Setup environment variables by coping `.env-sample` file to `.env` and fill it proper values
2. Run the PostgreSQL using docker-compose:

```shell
docker-compose --profile dev up -d [--build]
```

If you encounter problems with docker-compose, you may run:

```
$ docker-compose down [--rmi local] [--remove-orphans] [-v]
```

- `docker-compose down` will stop & remove the containers
- `--rmi local` will remove local images
- `--remove-orphans` will remove unneeded orphan containers
- `-v` will remove volumes (**WARNING: THIS WILL WIPE ALL YOUR OLD LOCAL DATABASE DATA**)

### Running the application

```shell
npm run dev
```

### Lint and formatting

We recommend that you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to work on the project. We use [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) & [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to keep our code consistent in terms of style and reducing defects. We recommend installing the the [ESLint Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) & [Prettier Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) as well.

Reference: [Setting up ESlint with Standard and Prettier](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/setting-up-eslint-with-standard-and-prettier-be245cb9fc64)

### Other Extension

- [pretty-ts-errors](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors): make TS error message readable

### Local API testing

We use [REST Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client) extension to test the API locally. You can find the API test scripts in `docs/scripts` folder.

### Migrations

Generate new migration file from an entity:

Automatic migration generation creates a new migration file and writes all sql queries that must be executed to update the database.
If no there were no changes generated, the command will exit with code 1.

```
$ npm run typeorm migration:generate ./migrations/{MigrationName}
```

Run migrations:

```
$ npm run typeorm migration:run
```

Reverts last executed migration:

```
$ npm run typeorm migration:revert
```
